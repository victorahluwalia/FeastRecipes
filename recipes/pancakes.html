  <h3>Pancakes</h3>
  <p>Pancakes are a classic breakfast dish that can be made in a variety of flavors and styles. Whether you prefer them fluffy and thin or thick and cake-like, pancakes are a staple for a comforting and delicious breakfast.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract, if using.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Some small lumps are okay.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with cooking spray or butter.</li>
    <li>Scoop 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan for each pancake. Cook until small bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat as needed.</li>
    <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as syrup, fruit, or whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
