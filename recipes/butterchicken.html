  <h3>Butter Chicken</h3>
  <p>Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular Indian dish made with tender pieces of chicken simmered in a creamy tomato-based sauce. The dish is rich, flavorful, and perfect for serving with rice, naan, or roti.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb boneless chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 inch ginger, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 cup canned crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large pan, heat some oil over medium heat and cook the chicken until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.</li>
    <li>In the same pan, add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and minced ginger. Cook until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, garam masala, paprika, turmeric, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes to let the flavors develop.</li>
    <li>Return the chicken to the pan and add the heavy cream and butter. Stir to combine and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened.</li>
    <li>Serve the butter chicken with rice, naan, or roti, garnished with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
